Probability Map Viewer
======================

Formerly known as  **Segmenter**

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CRBS/probabilitymapviewer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CRBS/probabilitymapviewer) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/CRBS/probabilitymapviewer/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/CRBS/probabilitymapviewer?branch=master)

Probability Map Viewer is a web application using an embedded [Jetty][jetty] web server that 
performs probability map generation in near real time on tiled image data. 
Probability Map Viewer is designed to be run on a linux machine with the web application
viewable locally or remotely via a web browser.

Probability map generation can be performed by an external command line script.

![Probability Map Viewer in Single Image Analysis Mode](docs/single.png)

Probability Map Viewer supports two modes, a single image analysis mode and collection mode. 
In collection mode Probability Map Viewer automatically switches to the latest image that 
appears in a user specified directory.

Requirements
============

* Centos 6+, Ubuntu 12+, and most other linux distributions should work
* [Java][java] 8+ **(jdk to build)**
* [Image Magick][imagemagick] command line programs (namely **convert**)
* [Matlab Runtime 2013a][matlabruntime] (needed to run [CHM][chm])
* [Maven][maven] 3.0 or higher **(to build)**
* [chmutil][chmutil] (used when probabilitymapviewer is converting dm4 files via **--dm4collectionmode**)
* [IMOD][imod] (used to convert dm4 files via **--dm4collectionmode**)


Running 
=======

A pre-built jar is available here: https://github.com/crbs/probabilitymapviewer/releases

Probability Map Viewer is started via the command line.  

For usage instructions run the following command 
(assuming the jar file is in the current working directory):

```Bash
java -jar probabilitymapviewer-<VERSION>-jar-with-dependencies.jar -h
```

**\<VERSION\>** will be the version of the Probability Map Viewer.

Building Probability Map Viewer manually  
===========================

Probability Map Viewer build requirements:

* [Java 8+][java] JDK
* [Maven][maven] 3.0 or higher **(to build)**

Commands build Probability Map Viewer assuming machine has [Git][git] command line tools 
installed:

```Bash
# In lieu of git one can just download repo and unzip it
git clone https://github.com/crbs/probabilitymapviewer.git

cd probabilitymapviewer
mvn clean test install
```

The above command will create a jar file under **target/** named 
**probabilitymapviewer-\<VERSION\>-jar-with-dependencies.jar**
